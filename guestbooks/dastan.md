- Your data exploration was very thorough and well-explained. I like how you went through the trouble of retrieving the missing audiofiles instead of just leaving those records out and also really explored the age columns.

- I can't think of any real avenues for improvement, but I would be curious to see if sex or birthplace had any influence on people's accents. I'm also exctied to see how the accents will show up phonologically. One thing I'm also wondering about is if there is any sort of "standard" that non-native speakers could be compared to since english is spoken in so many different parts of the world. For instance, my friend who grew up in China watched a lot of British TV growing up and therefore has some british influence on her accent, while some of my other non-native English speaking friends don't.

- The very thorough exploration of the data and aim to explain possible anomalies was very inspiring for my own project.
