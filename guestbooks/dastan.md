`Dastan`: Thanks to everyone reviewd my work, I will be sure to implement all your recommednations. I appreciate all the feedback
## Teresa's comments
- Your data exploration was very thorough and well-explained. I like how you went through the trouble of retrieving the missing audiofiles instead of just leaving those records out and also really explored the age columns.

- I can't think of any real avenues for improvement, but I would be curious to see if sex or birthplace had any influence on people's accents. I'm also exctied to see how the accents will show up phonologically. One thing I'm also wondering about is if there is any sort of "standard" that non-native speakers could be compared to since english is spoken in so many different parts of the world. For instance, my friend who grew up in China watched a lot of British TV growing up and therefore has some british influence on her accent, while some of my other non-native English speaking friends don't.

- The very thorough exploration of the data and aim to explain possible anomalies was very inspiring for my own project.

`Dastan`: Thank you for the input, I will be sure to look at those biographical speaker factors in my analysis-Dastan

## Riley's Feedback
- Done Well: I liked your visualizations at the end, and your notebook is well organized.
- Improvement: You're fully flashing your data frames which takes up a lot of unnecessary space. You could use .head()
- What I learned: I learned about how you could handle sorting sound files

`Dastan`: Thanks for dropping by, I will make sure to contain the way I view the data from now on, for some reason it looks different when I run it on my PC vs on GitHub-Dastan

## Maya's Feedback
- I'm very impressed by your initiative to contact the professor in charge of the project and get extra data that you weren't able to find on Kaggle. I think this will benefit not only your analysis, but also the ultimate reach your project will have now that you have a contact at GMU. Great work!
- Your repo is looking really great so I don't have much to critique. One thing you could do is give a brief summary at the beginning or end of your notebooks to give the viewer a quick snapshot of the purpose and content of the notebook. Similarly, I think it could be helpful to utilize hyperlinks to allow the viewer to quickly access the section they want to go to. 
- I learned that you can use UTF-8 to encode IPA characters...I only have experience using DISC codes so I didn't realize how easy it could be to process the IPA alphabet.

`Dastan`: Thank you so much, that is a wonderful idea, something like a table of contents would be great for navigation, I'll make sure to implement it next time-Dastan

## Maddy's Feedback
- I was really impressed by the fact that you contacted the author of the dataset and got more data out of it! I never would have thought to try that.
- It would be nice to have some sort of brief conclusion in you jupyter notebooks.
- I didn't know pandas could read excel documents! I also had never thought about trying to process rtf files, it's nice that there's a python module for that.

`Dastan`: Thank you for the feedback, I'll be sure to add some more overviews for the notebooks, I have a bad habit of diving right into the code and poking around-
