# Teresa's comments

- Your data is in a very clean format. It seemed like the web scraping turned out really well so you have a ton of data to work with! I also think it was very clever to include the username of the person who wrote the comment, in case they've written multiple comments. 

- This isn't really an avenue for improvement, but I just wonder if the fact that some subreddits may be more picture-based might mess with your analysis a bit, since you're only able to analyze the descriptions of the photos included. This might just mean narrowing down the choice of subreddits for analysis.

- I personally found web scraping a little difficult so it was impressive to see it done so well. I definitely learned from the way you did it. I also think the data-sharing idea was a very good one and think I might approach my data sharing in a similar manner.
