## Maddy's feedback
- The notebook was easy to follow and every step was explained. You seem to already have a good understanding of your dataset.
- Overall very good, but it could have been interesting to have a few more visualizations of the data.
- I hadn't heard of `natsort` before! That's a very interesting module.
