# Stance Taking in Spontaneous Speech
Welcome to Maya Asher's guestbook! Feel free to leave feedback on their [repo](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2024/Stance-Taking-in-Spontaneous-Speech) below...

## Maddy's feedback
- The notebook was easy to follow and every step was explained. You seem to already have a good understanding of your dataset.
- Overall very good, but it could have been interesting to have a few more visualizations of the data.
- I hadn't heard of `natsort` before! That's a very interesting module.

## Dastan's feedback
- Overall you did a really goodjob analyzing the data, very clear cut and to the point. Also those `.trn` files look terrifying! props for tackling them. I liked the visualization that you did towards the end and in the progress report you included what the next steps are going to be for the project, which tells me that you already have a plan.

- In terms of the notebook, I would recommend adding more markdown cells and explaining why you do some of the stuff that you do (such as the removal). While a linguistically inclined audience might understand, people from the other fields won't and they'd have to dig through the project to see what you're trying to do.
