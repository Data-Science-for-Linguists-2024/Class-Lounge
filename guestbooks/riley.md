## Maya's feedback
- You have a good understanding of you data and a clear direction for your analysis. Your process of reordering and combining the dataframes was very clean and you utilized Pandas well. 
- In your Jupyter Notebook, you flash your dataframes in their entirety which negatively impacts readability. I would suggest using `.head()` and `.tail()` to just show a snippet of your data so the viewer understands what you are doing but isn't overwhelmed by pages of dataframes. 
- I learned that there are (at least) 4 relevant political parties in Germany, which stands in  contrast to the United State's 2 party system. 

## Maddy's feedback
- You seem to understand your dataset well and have a good idea of your plans for it, and your code was very understandable.
- This is just a minor note, but printing out smaller portions of the dataframes would improve your notebook's readability.
- Using a non-english dataset is very interesting. I'm excited to see where your projects goes! 
From Riley: <3 thanks for the tips y'all

## Teresa's feedback
- Your Jupyter notebook is very easy to follow with lots of explanation. I also appreciate the dedication to adding info about political party/position and gender, that must have taken a long time.
- Printing out the head of the df after adding the extra info would be nice, just to see what it looks like all together.
- It's exciting to see you using a dataset in German! There's a lot of political information here I didn't know about before. I'm so curious to see what the results will be.

## Dastan's feedback
- Overall very nice and structured, your notebook is very clear cut and easy to follow. I definitiely respect the dedication you put into adding the party and government bodies for each speaker that could not have been easy.
- This more towards the formatting of the notebooks. I feel like your manual assignment cells could be shorter if you used some sort of dictionary or hashmap and a loop. Also I'd recommend maybe adding some visualization, though they may have been left out intentionally for the analysis portion
- I did not know that pandas can read xml, that is definitiely very handy, I also did not know that you can print out unique() values inside of print(), I assumed it'd return an address or something instead, that's interesting.
