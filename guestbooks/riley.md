## Maya's feedback
- You have a good understanding of you data and a clear direction for your analysis. Your process of reordering and combining the dataframes was very clean and you utilized Pandas well. 
- In your Jupyter Notebook, you flash your dataframes in their entirety which negatively impacts readability. I would suggest using `.head()` and `.tail()` to just show a snippet of your data so the viewer understands what you are doing but isn't overwhelmed by pages of dataframes. 
- I learned that there are (at least) 4 relevant political parties in Germany, which stands in  contrast to the United State's 2 party system.
