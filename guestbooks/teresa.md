Welcome to my guestbook! Thanks for stopping by :)

## Maya's feedback
- Your visualizations were top-notch! I enjoyed the interactivity of maps and thought they were both visually appealing and informative. 
- I am struggling to provide an adequate suggestion because your methods are well thought out and your code is meticulously documented. I am curious as to which specific concepts you will end up analyzing and how many? You mentioned that there are over 2000 concepts and each could require its own dataframe, so I am curious to see how you narrow down your scope of investigation. Perhaps you could pick a few concepts that are related in some way or fit a theme? 
- I learned about new types of visualizations aside from the standard seaboarn/matplotlib graphs that we have been using. 

## Riley's Feedback
- Done Well: Your notebook is so clean and organized, and your explanations all make sense. Also, I agree with Maya. Yor visualizations are awesome, and it's really cool that they're interactive. It adds a lot to the presentation.
- Improvement: Honestly, your stuff is all well organized, clearly explained and seemingly thorough.
- What I learned: I learned about using plotly for visualizations. I had never heard of it before, and it makes some cool stuff.
