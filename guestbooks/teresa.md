Welcome to my guestbook! Thanks for stopping by :)

## Maya's feedback
- Your visualizations were top-notch! I enjoyed the interactivity of maps and thought they were both visually appealing and informative. 
- I am struggling to provide an adequate suggestion because your methods are well thought out and your code is meticulously documented. I am curious as to which specific concepts you will end up analyzing and how many? You mentioned that there are over 2000 concepts and each could require its own dataframe, so I am curious to see how you narrow down your scope of investigation. Perhaps you could pick a few concepts that are related in some way or fit a theme? 
- I learned about new types of visualizations aside from the standard seaboarn/matplotlib graphs that we have been using. 

	- Thanks for checking out my project :) - teresa

## Riley's Feedback
- Done Well: Your notebook is so clean and organized, and your explanations all make sense. Also, I agree with Maya. Yor visualizations are awesome, and it's really cool that they're interactive. It adds a lot to the presentation.
- Improvement: Honestly, your stuff is all well organized, clearly explained and seemingly thorough.
- What I learned: I learned about using plotly for visualizations. I had never heard of it before, and it makes some cool stuff.

	- Thanks for visiting! The maps were fun to make :) - teresa

## Maddy's feedback
- The notebooks are well organized and provide a clear view into your thought process writing them.
- I don't really have much negative feedback, your project seems to be coming along well.
- The interactive maps were really cool! I had no idea that was something you could do!

	- Thanks for the visit :) - teresa

 ## Dastan's feedback
- Wow your notebooks and structure look amazing! I was able to thoroughly follow along each step thanks to the plethora of comments and documentation you had along the way. I was fascinated by your navigation of the data, you had a lot of it, which can be overwhelming, but you managed to tell a story with it anyways despite the size.
- This is being slightly nit picky, but I'd maybe recommend adding some visualization to your notebook using seaborn or matplotlib.
- I learned that the Tamil characters are supported in utf-8, I am curious if there any languages that are not supported.
