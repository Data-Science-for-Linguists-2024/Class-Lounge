## Na-Rae the fake student:
- My 5-year-old ThinkPad laptop did ok! It has ... RAM, which worked ok with this much data, etc. Grepping through the whole of xxx json file took...

## Maddy
- I have a 3ish year-old Dell XPS 13 with 16GB of RAM and a mid range intel i7 processor
- Grepping through the file was relatively quick, only taking a few seconds
- Everything below 1,000,000 was relatively quick (< 1 minute), but that and above took several minutes and used all of my computer's memory
- I also tried the full file and gave up because it was taking too long and my computer was getting very hot
